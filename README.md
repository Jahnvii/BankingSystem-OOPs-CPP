# Bank Management System - C++ (OOP-Based)

This Bank Management System is a C++ project that implements core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It allows users to create and manage bank accounts with features like deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and transaction history.

## 🔹 Concepts Used

- Encapsulation: Private account details with public methods for controlled access.
- Inheritance: SavingsAccount class inherits from Account.
- Polymorphism: Virtual functions for deposit, withdrawal, and display operations.
- Abstraction: Bank class manages accounts without exposing implementation details.
- Static Members: Ensures unique account numbers.
- Dynamic Memory Management: Accounts are stored as pointers.
